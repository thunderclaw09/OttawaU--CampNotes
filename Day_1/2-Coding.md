# Coding and Java - 31 July 2023

Java is used for object oriented programming. 

The **main function** is the entry point of the program. 

- **private** means that only one class can see it, while if you make a variable **public**, other classes can access it. Making it private means that other classes can't accidentally access it. The only way to access this is to create a function within that class that returns it.
